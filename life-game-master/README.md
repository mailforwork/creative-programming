# Here is a layout of basic tic tac toe game all on state management :

    // Define the initial state of the game board
    const state = {
      cells: [
        ['', '', ''],
        ['', '', ''],
        ['', '', '']
      ]
    };
    
    // Function to render the game board
    function renderBoard() {
      // Code to display the game board based on the state.cells array
    }
    
    // Function to handle a user clicking on a cell
    function handleCellClick(row, col) {
      // Code to update the state.cells array based on the user's click
      // Code to re-render the game board based on the updated state
    }
    
    // Attach click event listeners to each cell on the game board
    for (let row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
      for (let col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
        const cell = document.getElementById(`cell-${row}-${col}`);
        cell.addEventListener('click', () => {
          handleCellClick(row, col);
        });
      }
    }


> In this example, the state object is used in conjunction with other
> code to implement the game logic. The renderBoard function uses the
> state.cells array to display the game board on the screen. The
> handleCellClick function updates the state.cells array based on the
> user's click and then re-renders the game board using the updated
> state. The for loop at the end attaches click event listeners to each
> cell on the game board, which call the handleCellClick function when
> the user clicks on a cell.

> So in this example, the state object is just one part of a larger
> program that uses the state to keep track of the game board and update

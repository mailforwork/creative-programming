<!-- This is a piece of code written in JavaScript that is used to handle an onClick event.

The code creates an anonymous arrow function that will be executed when the element is clicked.

The function first creates a new copy of an existing grid using the produce function. The produce function is likely from the Immer library and creates a copy of a data structure (in this case, the grid array) while allowing for easy updates to the copy.

The grid array is likely a two-dimensional array representing a grid, and i and k are likely the row and column indices of a cell in the grid. The code sets the value of the cell at grid[i][k] to 1 in the new copy of the grid. -->
